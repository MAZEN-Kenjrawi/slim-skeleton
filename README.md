# MY Slim Skeleton v1.0

This is a kind of php skeleton for playing around purpose. 

*MVC* structured.

It has some helpful functions too, in `./bootstrap/functions.php` file.

I build it, for a some sort of challange, using tutorials and documentations.


I'll keep it updated with **playing around coding stuff** which I collect from my code journey and tutorials.



Have a good coding day!
